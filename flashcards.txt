Can a system of linear equations have infinitely many solutions? If yes, under what conditions?
Yes, it can have infinitely many solutions if it's underdetermined (fewer equations than variables) and consistent.
Compute the inverse of the following 2x2 matrix [a b; c d] and verify it by multiplying it with the original matrix.
- no answer - 
1. Given these two vectors (3, 4) and (4, -3), are they orthogonal? 2. Are these vectors (1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), and (7, 8, 9) linearly independent or dependent?
1. Yes, they are orthogonal as their dot product is zero.  2. They are linearly dependent because the rank of the matrix formed by these vectors is less than the number of vectors.
Define eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Given the following 2x2 matrix [a b; c d], calculate its eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
Eigenvectors are non-zero vectors that change at most by a scalar factor when a linear transformation is applied. Eigenvalues are the associated scalars. - no answer - for the given matrix.

Can you calculate the dot product of two matrices? If not, why?
No, you cannot calculate the dot product of two matrices as the operation is defined between two vectors, not matrices.

The Simplex Method or Simplex Algorithm is used for calculating the optimal solution to the linear programming problem. In other words, the simplex algorithm is an iterative procedure carried systematically to determine the optimal solution from the set of feasible solutions.
Define a vector and provide an example.
A vector is a quantity defined by direction and magnitude. Example: v = [3, 2].

A matrix is a two-dimensional array of numbers. Example: A = [1, 2; 3, 4].
What is a linear combination? Provide an example.
A linear combination is an expression constructed by multiplying terms by constants and adding the results. Example: 2v + 3w, where v and w are vectors.
What is a basis? Provide an example.
A basis is a set of vectors that spans a space and is linearly independent. Example: The vectors (1,0) and (0,1) form a basis for 2D.
Define orthogonality.
Orthogonality refers to perpendicularity in vectors; two vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is zero.
What is a dot product? Provide an example.
A dot product is an operation between two vectors that returns a scalar. Example: The dot product of a = [a1, a2, ..., an] and b = [b1, b2, ..., bn] is a1b1 + a2b2 + ... + an*bn.
What is linear independence?
A set of vectors is linearly independent if no vector in the set can be expressed as a linear combination of others.
What is the rank of a matrix?
The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent row vectors in the matrix.
What is the dimension of a vector space? Can you provide an example?
The dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in any basis for the space. For example, the dimension of the vector space R^3 is 3, because a basis for R^3 is {i, j, k}, which consists of 3 vectors.
What are the conditions for a matrix to be invertible?
A matrix is invertible if it is square (has the same number of rows as columns) and its determinant is non-zero.
Explain the concept of a subspace in linear algebra. Provide an example.
A subspace is a subset of a vector space that itself is a vector space under the same operations. For example, the x-y plane is a subspace of R^3.
What is the rank-nullity theorem in linear algebra?
The rank-nullity theorem states that the rank of a matrix (the maximum number of linearly independent row vectors in the matrix) plus the nullity of the matrix (the dimension of its null space) is equal to the number of its columns.
What does it mean if a matrix is symmetric?
A matrix is symmetric if it is equal to its transpose - that is, if you flip the matrix over its main diagonal, it remains the same.
Define and give an example of the cross product.
The cross product is a binary operation on two vectors in three-dimensional space, and it results in a vector which is perpendicular (orthogonal) to the plane containing the two original vectors. For example, the cross product of the vectors i and j is the vector k.
What is a diagonal matrix? Provide an example.
A diagonal matrix is a matrix in which the entries outside the main diagonal are all zero. For example, the matrix [1,0,0; 0,2,0; 0,0,3] is a diagonal matrix.
Explain the concept of a linear transformation. Give an example.
A linear transformation is a mapping V -> W between two modules (including vector spaces) that preserves the operations of addition and scalar multiplication. For example, the mapping (x, y) -> (x + 2, y - 3) is a linear transformation.
What is the identity matrix? Provide an example.
The identity matrix, often denoted by I, is a square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere. For example, the 2x2 identity matrix is [1,0; 0,1].
What is the concept of spanning in linear algebra?
Spanning in linear algebra refers to the creation of a set of all possible linear combinations that can be made from a given set of vectors. If a set of vectors spans a space, you can get to any point in that space by scaling and adding together those vectors.
Given the matrix A = [1, 6; 5, 2] and the vector v = [6, -5], verify if v is an eigenvector of A. If so, what are the eigenvalues?
Yes, v is an eigenvector of A. This can be verified by checking whether Av equals λv for some scalar λ. In this case, Av = [-24, 40], which is -4 times v, so λ = -4 is the eigenvalue.
